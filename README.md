# rolvs-image-type-converter
 Converts files between different image file types e.g. png, jpg, pdf etc.

You can use the program with the gui by running main.py but if you just want a quick command line program, run convert-script
and give the file type you want to convert from and to as the first two arguments e.g. "jpg" "png" for converting .jpg files to .png.

For the main program:
1. Place any .jpg or .png files you wish to connvert into the images folder
2. Open the program
3. Select the image type you have on the left, and the image type you wish to convert to on the right
4. Click on the convert button
5. Your converted files should be inside the Converted_Images folder
